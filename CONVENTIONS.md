# AI Coding Conventions

You are an expert React developer. Follow these rules when generating code:

1. **Functional Components:** Always use React Functional Components with Hooks.
2. **Tailwind CSS:** Use Tailwind classes for all styling. Do not create separate `.css` or `.scss` files unless absolutely necessary for global styles.
3. **File Naming:**
   - Components: `PascalCase.jsx` (e.g., `HeroSection.jsx`)
   - Utilities/Hooks: `camelCase.js` (e.g., `useScroll.js`)
4. **Clean Code:**
   - Keep components small and focused.
   - Destructure props.
   - Use meaningful variable names.
5. **Mobile First:** Always design for mobile screens first, then verify centering on desktop.
6. **No Placeholder Images:** Use `https://placehold.co/400x600` for vertical images and `https://placehold.co/600x400` for horizontal images if real assets are missing.
